I share knowledge about cloud best practices, serverless or anything else that might be useful for others:

**Featured**: I participated in Serverless Chats podcast and shared my viewpoint about [Differing Serverless Perspectives Between Cloud Providers](https://www.serverlesschats.com/103/)  

I'm an avid reader, whenever I come across an interesting material, I share it with my social circle along with a tl;dr which can be read in less than a minute:
